# Path-finder
A web program called Path-Finder helps visualize the practical applications of the Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm and the Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm.

For optimal pathfinding, Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms were combined, highlighting proficiency with data structures, web interactivity, and algorithm implementation.
