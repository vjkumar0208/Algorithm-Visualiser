# Algorithm Visualizer

**ðŸ”— Live Demo:** [https://vjkumar0208.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser/](https://vjkumar0208.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser/)

A web-based visualization tool that demonstrates the practical applications of pathfinding algorithms:
- Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (Prim's Algorithm)

## Features

- Interactive grid-based visualization
- Real-time algorithm execution
- Visual representation of:
  - Start and end points
  - Walls/obstacles
  - Path exploration
  - Final shortest path
  - Minimum spanning tree

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SVG for icons
- 
## Algorithms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Used for finding the shortest path between two points in a weighted graph.

### Prim's Algorithm
Used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph.

## How to Use

1. Click and drag to create walls/obstacles
2. Set start and end points
3. Choose an algorithm
4. Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action
